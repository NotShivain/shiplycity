# To install and test the app:
follow this google drive link ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ST4dnoF0AUrJ0kkLTkvTqz1Eav7l1zG/view?usp=sharing ) and download the apk file then open and install it on your device.
or if you want to build the app for ios/android yourself, just open this repo on your code editor, 
login to your expo account and run eas build --platform android or eas build --platform all for both ios and android on your terminal.

# Assumptions and key Decisions made during development
The main functionality defined in the coding case was implemented in the app along with placeholders of search and buy buttons.
There is no user authentication for now; this app is just for testing the estimated delivery time functionality.
